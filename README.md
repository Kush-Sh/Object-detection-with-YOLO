# Object Tracking with YOLO

In this project, we are tracking an object in environment with the help of object recognition algorithm. So, we can differentiate multiple objects in real time.

### Image classification is one of the many exciting applications of convolutional neural networks. Aside from simple image classification, there are plenty of fascinating problems in computer vision, with object detection being one of the most interesting. It is commonly associated with self-driving cars where systems blend computer vision, LIDAR and other technologies to generate a multidimensional representation of the road with all its participants.
In a real real-life scenario, we need to go beyond locating just one object but rather multiple objects in one image. For example, a self-driving car has to find the location of other cars, traffic lights, signs, humans and to take appropriate action based on this information.
